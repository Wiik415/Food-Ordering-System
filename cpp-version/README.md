This is a food order system with a simple user interface and is full of 3 types. functions within the overall action of the code. 
The three modules handle calculation of cost of the meal and enables the user to view. 
the final order and print a receipt to an external file when requested and allowing the user to place a 
new order not of the last.  

There are 5 food options in this system that include mushroom burger, crispy fried chicken, fish. and chips, spaghetti and meatballs, and hotdog sandwiches. All these food choices are of 
varying prices and the user can have any amount of food with any mixture that is. 
desired. 

With regard to the calculation of the price of the food, the system can calculate the. 
price of the food including tax, which in itself is dynamic depending on the overall price of the meal in the end. 
bill. Moreover, it is capable of showing the final bill in Malaysian Ringgit, dollar or euro, depending on the. 
user's preference.
